HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.
These tags make your HTML easier to read, and also help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

{% highlight html %}

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

<p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
